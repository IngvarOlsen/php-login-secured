# php-login

This is a fork from a very small application presenting an extremely-simple-and-almost-unrealistic login system written in PHP, which has been deliberately made vulnerable, but now have been updated except for the docker enviroment. 

Manual code review, and automated tests were done with Snyk, aswell as penetration tests

## Starting up the application

To build and run the Docker container, you need to type:

	docker-compose build
  
	docker-compose up
  

Then the web application can be accessed on: http://localhost:8001/php-login/
